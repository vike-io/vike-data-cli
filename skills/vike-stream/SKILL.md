description: Live events over WebSocket with `vike-data stream` - Hyperliquid fills, liquidations, positions, liquidation risk, order walls, closed candles, TWAPs, ledger, leverage changes and funding; HL cohort flow, indices and cohort bias; on-chain transfers on eth, bsc, base and hyperevm; Polymarket trades, resolutions, price moves and new markets - printed as NDJSON, resumed by cursor after any drop. Use when the user wants to "watch", "tail", "follow live", "stream" or "be notified as it happens" rather than query history.

# vike-stream

```bash
vike-data stream <hl|hl-cohorts|onchain|polymarket> --channel <channel...> [--filter key=value ...] [--cursor <cursor>]
```

Connects to `wss://stream.vike.io/v1/stream/<path>` with the API key in the `X-API-KEY` header, subscribes once per
`--channel`, and prints one JSON object per line on stdout: every `event` frame and every `gap` frame, exactly as the
server sent them. Status lines (subscribed, reconnecting, errors) go to stderr. It runs until Ctrl-C.

| Path | Channels |
|---|---|
| `hl` | `hl.fills`, `hl.liquidations`, `hl.positions`, `hl.liq_risk`, `hl.order_walls`, `hl.candles`, `hl.twaps`, `hl.ledger`, `hl.leverage`, `hl.funding` |
| `hl-cohorts` | `hl.cohort_flow`, `hl.indices`, `hl.cohort_bias` |
| `onchain` | `chain.transfers` |
| `polymarket` | `pm.trades`, `pm.resolutions`, `pm.price_moves`, `pm.new_markets` |

The server decides what each path serves: `vike-data stream info` prints the current channels and filter keys, and a
channel the path does not serve is refused with `unknown_channel` and the list. The CLI has no channel list of its own.

`hl.candles` is the Hyperliquid candle stream: closed bars, filtered by `coin`, `interval` (`1m 5m 15m 30m 1h 4h 1d`),
`market` (`perp` or `spot`) and `dex` (`HL` or a HIP-3 dex). The old `wss://data.vike.io/v1/stream` is closed (410).

## Examples

```bash
# Hyperliquid BTC and ETH fills of $100k or more, by smart wallets
vike-data stream hl --channel hl.fills --filter coin=BTC,ETH --filter min_usd=100000 --filter "pnl_cohort=3x smart,2x smart"

# Live 1-minute and 1-hour BTC and ETH perp candles (closed bars)
vike-data stream hl --channel hl.candles --filter coin=BTC,ETH --filter interval=1m,1h --filter market=perp

# Every liquidation and every fill of one wallet, on one connection
vike-data stream hl --channel hl.liquidations hl.fills --filter wallet=0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111

# USDC transfers on base of 1M USDC or more (min_amount is in tokens; min_usd would drop the unpriced events)
vike-data stream onchain --channel chain.transfers --filter chain=base --filter token=0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913 --filter min_amount=1000000

# Keep only the events, with jq
vike-data stream polymarket --channel pm.trades --filter min_usd=10000 | jq -c 'select(.type == "event") | .event'
```

`--filter` applies to every `--channel` of the command; a key the channel does not take is refused by the server
with the key's name. List keys (`wallet`, `coin`, `token`, `market`, `chain`, cohorts, ...) take comma-separated
values and repeat; `side`, `direction`, `event`, `axis`, `move`, `role` take one value; `true` / `false` is sent as a yes/no (`contract=false`); `min_usd`, `min_amount`, `min_move`
take a number. Channel fields and filter keys: https://vike.io/docs/data/reference/stream-channels

## Without a socket

These are MCP calls: they open no connection, so they never replace one.

```bash
vike-data stream info --json                                    # every path, channel, filter key, limit and close code
vike-data stream check hl.fills --filter coin=BTC --filter min_usd=50000   # the server's own validator; exit 1 if refused
vike-data stream events hl.liquidations --filter coin=BTC --since-ms 1793178870000 --json   # stored events (3 days), paged by --cursor
vike-data stream connections --hours 24 --json                  # your recent connections: who closed whom (4410), events sent
```

Run `stream check` before a long-running `stream`: it shows the filter exactly as the server will apply it (with
the `hl.fills` default `min_usd` of 1000 added) or the server's error naming the bad key.

## Reading the output

- Keep the **frame's** `cursor` (the top-level one, not `event.cursor`) of the last line you handled. `--cursor <it>`
  on the next run resumes from there, up to 3 days back; older is `cursor_expired` and the stream continues from now.
- The CLI resumes by itself after any drop (restart, network, slow reader) from the last cursor of each subscription.
  Delivery is at least once: drop a repeated `event.event_id`.
- A `gap` frame (`reason: channel_idle`) means the channel was not running between `from` and `to` (nobody was
  subscribed). It does not mean nothing happened; read that window from the REST endpoints or the `hl` / `polymarket`
  commands. For what a socket missed while the channel was running, `vike-data stream events <channel> --cursor <c>`.
- `hl.fills` without `min_usd` gets a $1,000 floor; `min_usd=0` is every fill (hundreds per second).
  `chain.transfers` unfiltered is a firehose; transfers are priced after they are streamed, so `min_usd` on it drops almost every event: filter by `wallet`, `token` (with `min_amount`), `entity`, `wallet_type` or `contract=false`.

## One connection per key

On each path, one API key holds one connection; an account holds at most 3. A second program on the same key and
path takes over, and the first exits with `replaced (4410)` and does not reconnect (two programs reconnecting would
take the connection from each other forever). Give each program its own key (`VIKE_API_KEY=... vike-data stream ...`).
`vike-data stream connections` shows which of your connections closed which.
Exit 1 also on `HTTP 401` / `4401` (the key) and on a refused subscription (`bad_subscription`, `unknown_channel`).

## Anti-patterns

- Don't run two `vike-data stream` processes on the same key and path: they replace each other.
- Don't treat silence as "nothing happened" in the first minutes: an idle channel starts on demand (up to ~12 minutes
  for `hl.indices` and `hl.liq_risk`).
- Don't use the stream for history: it keeps 3 days. Use the query commands.

## Pairs well with

- `vike-alerts-setup`: a stored rule that notifies by webhook without a running process.
- `vike-hl-top-traders`: pick the wallets to put in a `wallet` filter.
- Playbooks with a live section: `vike-hl-liquidation-radar` (`hl.liq_risk`, `hl.liquidations`), `vike-follow-the-money` (`chain.transfers`), `vike-hl-cohort-positioning` (`hl.cohort_bias`, `hl.indices`), `vike-hl-trader-profile`, `vike-pm-market-diligence`.
