description: Multi-source label cascade for an Ethereum wallet — shows what each upstream label source AND our in-house heuristic classifier says about an address, with consensus entity/type and per-source attribution. Use when the user asks "who is this address" / "what do you know about this wallet" / "is this address labeled" / "why is this wallet labeled X".

# vike-wallet-label-provenance

The headline differentiator: we don't just show a label, we show **which sources agree** and how confident the consensus is.

## Command

```bash
vike-data labels <address> [--json]
```

Ethereum wallets only. For another chain, or many addresses, use `vike-data wallet batch --chain ethereum|bsc|base`, which reads each chain's own label table.

## Example

```bash
vike-data labels 0x28C6c06298d514Db089934071355E5743bf21d60     # Binance Hot Wallet 14
```

## Output shape

```json
{
  "address": "0x...",
  "found": true,
  "consensus": {
    "entity": "binance",
    "wallet_type": "cex",
    "cex_product": "retail",
    "user_subtype": "active",
    "risk_flag": null,
    "confidence": "medium"
  },
  "sources": [
    { "source": "provider_a", "label": "Binance: Hot Wallet (0x28C)", "entity": "Binance", "category": "Hot Wallet" },
    { "source": "provider_b", "label": "Binance 14", "entity": "binance", "category": null },
    { "source": "provider_c", "label": "Binance: Hot Wallet", "entity": "binance", "category": "exchange" },
    { "source": "provider_d", "label": "binance", "entity": "binance", "category": null },
    { "source": "heuristic:cold_t1", "label": "binance", "confidence": 0.94 }
  ],
  "source_count": 5
}
```

Sources are anonymised on the wire (`provider_a`, `provider_b`, ...). There are at most 6 raw sources (Arkham, OLI, Blockscout, Dune, the MEW darklist, Etherscan tags), plus the heuristic classifier as a `heuristic:*` source. `source_count` includes the heuristic.

## Reading

- **4+ raw sources agree on the entity** → very high confidence; ship the label without caveats. Six is the ceiling, and most labelled wallets have 1-3.
- **2-3 sources agree on the same entity** → high confidence
- **Only 1 source (± heuristic)** → moderate; mention "labeled by one source"
- **Only the heuristic** → low; mention "predicted by heuristic"
- **`found: true` with no sources** → the wallet is in our label table but no raw source labels it
- **`found: false`** → the wallet is missing from our labelled-wallet table, and no source is consulted at all. It does NOT prove that no provider labels it. Say "not in our label table", not "unlabeled" or "clean".

Early answers (before 2026-10-19) carried only the Arkham-derived source and the heuristic, so older transcripts undercount sources.

## Anti-patterns

- Don't quote any single provider's category field as "the category" — provider taxonomies vary; the `consensus.wallet_type` is the unified field.
- A `risk_flag` of `scam` / `sanctioned` / `phishing` is high-stakes — always mention it explicitly, never bury it.
- Don't use this for a BSC or Base address: it reads Ethereum tables only.

## Pairs well with

- `vike-data wallet summary <addr>` — for the flow metrics of the labeled wallet
- `vike-data wallet batch <addr...>` — label many addresses, or another chain
